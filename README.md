Overview:
This project is my first step into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and Pandas.
The dataset contains airline passenger bookings, and I explore trends such as class distribution and other key insights.
Answered simple business-related questions using data.


Dataset:
Columns: Passenger details (Class, Price, etc.)
No missing values in this dataset.


Tools Used:
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib for basic visualizations


Analysis Performed: 
Uploading Data
Number of times each destination city occured
Number of times Each class occured
Average, Middle and Most common overall Prices and Prices by class
Are there any null Values?
Show Bar Graphs representing the Departure Time & Arrival Time


Next Steps:
In future iterations, I plan to Add more visualizations, Explore correlations between price and class.
